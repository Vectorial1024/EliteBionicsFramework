[h1]Background and Overview[/h1]
Elite Bionics Framework is the child of the abandoned, never-released mod Elite Bionics (ELTE). Originally drafted in Fall 2018, the idea was that, because installing bionics will make pawns weaker by reducing the HP pool ([url=https://ludeon.com/forums/index.php?topic=15704.0]Ludeon Forums[/url]), ELTE bionics would trade some of the bonus body part efficiency buff for max HP buff.

This would make ELTE an interesting competitor to the bionics duopoly at the time (EPOE and RBSE), but due to the lack of art skills and general creativity, ELTE was scrapped.

To not let the programming effort go to waste, the underlying tech that buffs max HP was reorganized to become the Elite Bionics Framework.

Cheers to the ambition of becoming the third greatest bionics mod after EPOE and RBSE!

[h1]Framework Description[/h1]
Other modders may manipulate body parts through this framework. Currently, these manipulations are supported:
[list]
[*]Changing max HP of body part (v1.0.0)
[*]Changing melee attack damage of bionics (v2.1.0)
[/list]
Note that, normally, when body part max HP is increased, the pain and bleeding rate will both also increase. This mod scales down the bleeding rate in order to avoid nonsensical instant-death situations due to instant-bleed-out.

However, pain levels are not touched to maintain balance. End users should aim for drugs, implants, or armor to reduce the pain of your soldiers/workers before and during battle.

Modders (and perhaps end users too) may refer and subscribe to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1744648077]Elite Archotech[/url], another mod under my name, for inspiration and immediate usage.

There are some documentation on GitHub for modders too.

[h1]Known Issues and Latest News[/h1]
[list]
[*]This framework will emit warnings if it detects any mod that tries to get the max HP of body parts without using this framework.
[*]Uninstalling this mod may have problems: if a body part sustains injury such that total severity exceeds the vanilla-allowed max HP, the body part is instantly destroyed. This is vanilla behavior.
